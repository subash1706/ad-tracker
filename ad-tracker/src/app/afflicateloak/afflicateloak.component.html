    <h5>Did you know how easy it is for someone to hijack your affiliate commissions?</h5>
    <p>
        If youâ€™re promoting affiliate links without hiding your affiliate details,
        then all a potential thief has to do is replace your affiliate ID with his 
        own ID while making a purchase.He gets the commission, and you get absolutely nothing! 
        Affiliate commission hijacking is an annoying reality, especially in affiliate networks
        like ClickBank that actually encourages affiliates to buy with their own affiliate link.
